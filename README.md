# Pointer networks

This implements the model from [Pointer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03134) in PyTorch.

The convex hull data generation code was copied from [here](https://github.com/vshallc/PtrNets).

## Requirements
1. pytorch 1.0.0
2. TODO: requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Convex Hull prediction
    1. Generate the data using `convex_hull_generator.py`
    2. train-ptr-convex.ipynb contains the training notebook for convex hull problem
